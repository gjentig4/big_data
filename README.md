# Big Data

This is a brief guide on how to fck around with the Pandas and other libraries library in Python.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed on your computer:

- Python 3
- Pandas library

### Load the Data

```
# Import the Pandas library using the alias 'pd'
import pandas as pd

# Load the homelessness data
homelessness = pd.read_csv("homelessness.csv")
```
### Analyze the Data
```
# Print the values of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.values)

# Print the column names of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.columns)

# Print the row index of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.index)
```
### Sort the Data
```
# Sort the homelessness data by the number of individuals, in ascending order
homelessness_ind = homelessness.sort_values("individuals", ascending=True)

# Sort the homelessness data by the number of family members, in ascending order
homelessness_fam = homelessness.sort_values("family_members", ascending=True)

# Print the top few rows of the sorted homelessness data by family members
print(homelessness_fam.head())

# Sort the homelessness data by region, then by the number of family members, in ascending order
homelessness_reg_fam = homelessness.sort_values(["region", "family_members"], ascending=[True, False])

# Print the bottom few rows of the sorted homelessness data by region and family members
print(homelessness_reg_fam.tail())

```
## Subsetting columns
When working with data, you may not need all of the variables in your dataset. Square brackets ([]) can be used to select only the columns that matter to you in an order that makes sense to you. To select only ``"col_a"`` of the DataFrame df, use

```df["col_a"]```
To select "col_a" and "col_b" of df, use

df[["col_a", "col_b"]]
homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

Print the head of the result.
Create a DataFrame called state_fam that contains only the state and family_members columns of homelessness, in that order.
Print the head of the result.
Create a DataFrame called ind_state that contains the individuals and state columns of homelessness, in that order.
