# Big Data

This is a brief guide on how to fck around with the Pandas and other libraries library in Python.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed on your computer:

- Python 3
- Pandas library

### Load the Data

```
# Import the Pandas library using the alias 'pd'
import pandas as pd

# Load the homelessness data
homelessness = pd.read_csv("homelessness.csv")
```
### Analyze the Data
```
# Print the values of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.values)

# Print the column names of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.columns)

# Print the row index of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.index)
```
### Sort the Data
```
# Sort the homelessness data by the number of individuals, in ascending order
homelessness_ind = homelessness.sort_values("individuals", ascending=True)

# Sort the homelessness data by the number of family members, in ascending order
homelessness_fam = homelessness.sort_values("family_members", ascending=True)

# Print the top few rows of the sorted homelessness data by family members
print(homelessness_fam.head())

# Sort the homelessness data by region, then by the number of family members, in ascending order
homelessness_reg_fam = homelessness.sort_values(["region", "family_members"], ascending=[True, False])

# Print the bottom few rows of the sorted homelessness data by region and family members
print(homelessness_reg_fam.tail())

```
